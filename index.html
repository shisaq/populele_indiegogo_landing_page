<h2><span>Music = Magic.</span></h2>
<p>We all know that music has the power to make life more meaningful, but learning an instrument can be tough. Tech has come a long way, but instruments just haven't kept up with the pace. Born from the conviction that learning music should be just as fun as playing it, Populele is our first attempt to unify handcrafted instruments with technology that empowers people to achieve musical excellence on their own terms.</p>
